This owner didn\\'t even excuse himself to go wash his hands, change his gloves or wipe down the equipment where he blow snot all over. And best believe I left that nasty ass sub on that counter and walked out the store. There was a woman (DoorDash/Grub Hub driver) sitting and waiting to pick up an order. She asked me, \"Did he just sneezed?\" I said, \"He sure did and didn\\'t go wash his hands.\" After a while, I called up Subway. I wanted to get the corporate office information to file a grievance.
